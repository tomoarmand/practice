### Create a Component with a Prop

1. Write the code to create a component and import it into App.jsx.
2. Call the component `WhereAreWe`.  It should:
- Receive a single prop called `station`
- Render the word `You are currently in ` followed by the `name` prop

3. Import a component into App.jsx under `WhereAreWe` component.  It should:
- Render the weather with the text as `19C`
- Show an image `partly_cloudy.png` from the asset folder
- Set the value of the `alt` attribute on the image to `"It is a bit warm today"`
